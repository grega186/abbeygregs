        Your eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the
        narrow, <br />
        long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards, in
        light-<br />
        coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depicting,
        <br />
        respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named
        <br />
        Ville-de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a <br />
        leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which
        <br />
        would slide back at the merest touch. There, the carpet would give
        <br />
        way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, partly covered by three <br />
        faded rugs. It would be a living room about twenty-three feet long
        <br />
        by ten feet wide. On the left, in a kind of recess, there would be a
        <br />
        large sofa upholstered in worn black leather, with pale cherrywood
        <br />
        bookcases on either side, heaped with books in untidy piles. Above
        <br />
        the sofa, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that sec-
        <br />
        tion of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and be-<br />
        neath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-<br />
        headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there <br />
        would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, <br />
        with a light-brown velvet covering; it would <br />
        lead on to a small and spindly piece of <br />
        furniture, lacquered in dark red and <br />
        providing three display shelves <br />
        for knick-knacks: agates and <br />
        stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy-<br />boxes, jade ashtrays, a mother-<br />
        of-pearl oystershell, a silver <br />
        fob watch, a cut-glass glass, a <br />
        crystal pyramid, a miniature in <br />
        an oval frame. Further on, beyond <br />
        a padded door, there would be shelving <br />
        on both sides of the corner, for caskets and <br />
        for records, beside a closed gramophone of <br />
        which only four machined-steel knobs would <br />
        be visible, and above it, a print depicting The Great <br />
        Parade of the Military Tattoo. Through the window, dra- <br />
        ped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy <br />
        wallpaper, you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park, a bit <br />
        of street. A roll-top desk littered with papers and pen-holders <br />
        would go with a small cane-seated chair. On a console table <br />
        would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. Then, on <br />
        the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving <br />
        bookcase supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue<br />
        and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a <br />
        mahogany frame, there would be a narrow table with its two ben- <br />
        ches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the
        <br />
        leather curtain. It would be all in browns, ochres, duns and yellows:<br />
        a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calcu-<br />
        lated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be
        <br />
        some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish orange,
        <br />
        a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes.
        <br />
        During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little
        <br />
        sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter,
        <br />
        with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner,
        <br />
        the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and
        <br />
        the vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow,<br />
        whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich, heavy
        <br />
        silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a haven of
        peace,
        <br />
        a land of happiness. The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor
        <br />
        covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. An English double bed would
        <br />
        fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the
        window, there <br />
        would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read
        <br />
        and read again, photograph albums, packs of cards, pots, necklaces,
        paste
        <br />
        jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of
        wood
        <br />
        and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in
        thin-<br />
        striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving
        on<br />
        to a bathroom you would glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid
        <br />
        brass, a large adjustable mirror, a pair of cut-throat razors and their
        green <br />
        leather sheaths, bottles, horn-handled brushes, sponges.

        On the wall, above the bed made up and turned down for the night,
        between <br />
        two small wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow black-and-white
        photo-<br />
        graph of a bird in the sky would surprise you by its slightly formal
        perfec- <br />tion. The second door would reveal a study. From top to
        bottom the walls <br />would be lined with books and periodicals with,
        here and there, so as to <br />break the continuity of bindings and
        jackets, a number of prints, drawings<br />
        and photographs - Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The
        <br />Triumph of Saint George, one of Piranesi's dungeons, a portrait by
        Ingres,<br />a little pen- and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint
        photograph of Renan <br />in his room at the Collège de France, a
        Steinberg department store, Cranach's <br />Melanchthon - pinned to
        wooden panels set into the shelving. Slightly to <br />the left of the
        window and at a shallow angle would be a long country table
        <br />covered with a large red blotter. Wooden boxes, flat pen-holders
        and pots of <br />all kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples
        large and small. A <br />glass tile would serve as an ashtray. A
        circular black leather box <br />decorated with gold-leaf arabesques
        would be filled with cig-<br />arettes. Light would come from an old
        desk-lamp, ad-<br />justable only with difficulty, fitted with a green
        opa-<br />line lampshade shaped like a visor. On each side<br />
        of the table, virtually facing each other, <br />would be two
        high-backed wood and <br />leather armchairs. Still further to <br />the
        left, along the wall, would be<br />
        a narrow table overflowing with <br />books. A wing-chair in
        bottle-green<br />
        leather would lead to grey metal filing <br />cabinets and light wooden
        card-index
        <br />
        boxes. On a third, even smaller table <br />would be a Swedish lamp and
        a type-writer<br />
        under its canvas dust-cover. Right at the back<br />
        would be a narrow bed covered in ultramarine velvet <br />and stacked
        with cushions of all colours. On a painted wooden <br />
        stand, almost in the middle of the room, there would be a globe
        <br />made of papier-mâché and nickel silver, illustrated in naïf style,
        a <br />fake antique. Behind the desk, half-hidden by the red curtain at
        the <br />window, would be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a
        brass <br />rail all the way round the room. There, life would be easy,
        simple. All <br />the servitudes, all the problems brought by material
        existence would <br />find a natural solution. A cleaning lady would
        come every morning. Ev-<br />ery fortnight, wine, oil and sugar would be
        delivered. There would be a <br />huge, bright kitchen with blue tiles
        decorated with heraldic emblems, three <br />china plates decorated with
        yellow arabesques in metallic paint, cupboards <br />everywhere, a
        handsome whitewood table in the middle with stools and
        <br />bench-seats. It would be pleasant to come and sit there, every
        morning, after <br />a shower, scarcely dressed. On the table there
        would be a sizeable stoneware <br />butter dish, jars of marmalade,
        honey, toast, grapefruit cut in two. They would <br />open the mail,
        they would open the newspapers. They would light their first<br />
        cigarette. They would go out. Their work would keep them busy for a few
        hours <br />only, in the morning. They would meet for lunch, a sandwich
        or a steak, accord-<br />ing to their mood; they would have coffee at a
        street café and then go home, on <br />foot, slowly. Their flat would
        rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its <br />greatest
        charm. They would hardly bother themselves with it: they would live<br />
        in it. The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an
        established <br />fact, a datum, a state of their nature. Their
        attention would be elsewhere: on the<br />
        book they would open, on the text they would draft, on the record they
        would <br />listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. They
        would work for a long <br />while. Then they would dine, or go out for
        dinner; they would see old friends; <br />they would walk together.
        Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could <br />be led
        harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so
        <br />perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing
        these bright, soft, <br />simple and beautiful things had only ever been
        made for their sole use. But they <br />wouldn't feel enslaved by them:
        on some days, they would go off on a chance <br />adventure. No plan
        seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or
        <br />
        bitterness, or envy. For their means and their desires would always
        match in
        <br />
        all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their
        freedom, with <br />
        their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and to
        reveal it in <br />
        every moment of their living, together.
