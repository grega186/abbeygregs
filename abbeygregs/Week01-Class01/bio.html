    <p> My name is Abbey Gregory. I am from Portland, Oregon and moved to New York City in August of 2018. <br>
      I am studying Communication Design at Parsons and Political Science at Lang. I am currently starting <br>
      my fourth semester of school and will complete my two degrees in five years. I live in Greenpoint Brooklyn <br>
      with my three other roommates, who all also go to Lang. When I arrived at school I was originally studying <br>
      Fashion Design at Parsons and Journalism at Lang, but after my first full year I switched both of my majors. <br>
      I have very little experience in Graphic Design but I am really enjoying learning the medium and am very <br>
      happy with my choice to switch my majors. I realized that Fashion Design was a passion of mine, but I was not <br>
      going to enjoy it if I was forced into making more than I wanted. </p>
