                    About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached
the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the
gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr.
Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little
later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg
in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started
through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and

then the sound of someone splashing after us over the sog-
gy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed

glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books
in the library one night three months before.

                 <br>He had come a long
                    way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so
                    close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know
                    that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast
                    
                    obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the re-
                    public rolled on under the night.
                    
                    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future
                    that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but
                    that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out
                    our arms farther.... And one fine morning——
                    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
                    ceaselessly into the past.
