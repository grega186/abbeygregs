    Your eye, first of all, would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the narrow, <br> long and high-ceilinged corridor. Its walls would be cupboards, in light-<br> 
    coloured wood, with fittings of gleaming brass. Three prints, depicting, <br> respectively, the Derby winner Thunderbird, a paddle-steamer named <br> 
    Ville-de-Motitereau, and a Stephenson locomotive, would lead to a <br> leather curtain hanging on thick, black, grainy wooden rings which <br> 
    would slide back at the merest touch. There, the carpet would give <br> way to an almost yellow woodblock floor, partly covered by three <br> faded rugs.

  It would be a living room about twenty-three feet long <br> by ten feet wide. On the left, in a kind of recess, there would be a <br> 
    large sofa upholstered in worn black leather, with pale cherrywood <br> bookcases on either side, heaped with books in untidy piles. Above <br> 
    the sofa, a mariner's chart would fill the whole length of that sec- <br> tion of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and be-<br> 
    neath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with three large-<br> headed brass studs, matching the leather curtain, there <br> 
    would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, <br> 
    with a light-brown velvet covering; it would <br> lead on to a small and spindly piece of <br> furniture, lacquered in dark red and <br> 
    providing three display shelves <br> for knick-knacks: agates and <br> stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy-<br>boxes, jade ashtrays, a mother-<br>
    of-pearl oystershell, a silver <br> fob watch, a cut-glass glass, a <br> crystal pyramid, a miniature in <br> an oval frame. Further on, beyond <br> 
    a padded door, there would be shelving <br> on both sides of the corner, for caskets and <br> for records, beside a closed gramophone of <br> 
    which only four machined-steel knobs would <br> be visible, and above it, a print depicting The Great <br> 
    Parade of the Military Tattoo. Through the window, dra- <br> ped with white and brown curtains in cloth imitating Jouy <br> wallpaper, you would glimpse a few trees, a tiny park, a bit <br>
    of street. A roll-top desk littered with papers and pen-holders <br> would go with a small cane-seated chair. On a console table <br> 
    would be a telephone, a leather diary, a writing pad. Then, on <br>
    the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving <br> 
    bookcase supporting a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue<br> 
    and filled with yellow roses, set beneath an oblong mirror in a <br> 
    mahogany frame, there would be a narrow table with its two ben- <br> 
    ches upholstered in tartan, which would bring your eye back to the <br>
    leather curtain.

  It would be all in browns, ochres, duns and yellows:<br> 
    a world of slightly dull colours, in carefully graded shades, calcu-<br> 
    lated with almost too much artistry, in the midst of which would be <br>
    some striking, brighter splashes - a cushion in almost garish orange, <br>
    a few multicoloured book jackets amongst the leather-bound volumes. <br>
    During the day, the light flooding in would make this room seem a little <br>
    sad, despite the roses. It would be an evening room. But in the winter, <Br>
    with the curtains drawn, some spots illuminated - the bookcase corner, <br>
    the record shelves, the desk, the low table between the two settees, and <Br>
    the vague reflections in the mirror — and large expanses in shadow,<br>
    whence all the things would gleam - the polished wood, the rich, heavy <br> 
    silks, the cut glass, the softened leather — it would be a haven of peace, <br>
    a land of happiness.

  The first door would open onto a bedroom, its floor <br>
    covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet. An English double bed would <br>
    fill the whole rear part of it. On the right, to both sides of the window, there <br> 
    would be tall and narrow sets of shelves holding a few books, to be read <br> 
    and read again, photograph albums, packs of cards, pots, necklaces, paste <br> 
    jewellery. To the left, an old oak wardrobe and two clothes horses of wood <br>
    and brass would stand opposite a small wing-chair upholstered in thin-<br> 
    striped grey silk and a dressing table. Through a half-open door giving on<br>
    to a bathroom you would glimpse thick bathrobes, swan-neck taps in solid <br> 
    brass, a large adjustable mirror, a pair of cut-throat razors and their green <br> 
    leather sheaths, bottles, horn-handled brushes, sponges. The bedroom walls <br> 
    would be papered with chintz; the bedspread would be a tartan blanket. A <br> 
bedside table, with an openwork copper band running round three of its <br> 
    sides, would support a silver candlestick lamp topped with a very pale grey <br> 
    silk shade, a square carriage clock, a rose in a stem-vase, and, on its lower <br> 
    shelf, folded newspapers and some magazines. Further on, at the foot of <br> 
    the bed, there would be a big pouf in natural hide. At the window, the gauze <br> 
    curtains would slide on brass rods; the thick woollen double curtains would <br> 
    be half drawn. In the half-light the room would still be bright. On the wall, <br> 
    above the bed made up and turned down for the night, between two small <br> 
    wall lamps, the astonishing, long, narrow black-and-white photograph of a <br> 
    bird in the sky would surprise you by its slightly formal perfection.

  The <br> 
    second door would reveal a study. From top to bottom the walls would be <br> 
    lined with books and periodicals with, here and there, so as to break the<br>
continuity of bindings and jackets, a number of prints, drawings and photo-<br> 
    graphs - Antonello da Messina's Saint Jerome, a detail from The Triumph of <br> 
    Saint George, one of Piranesi's dungeons, a portrait by Ingres, a little pen-<br> 
    and-ink landscape by Klee, a sepia-tint photograph of Renan in his room at <br> 
    the Collège de France, a Steinberg department store, Cranach's Melanchthon <br> 
    - pinned to wooden panels set into the shelving. Slightly to the left of the win-<br> 
    dow and at a shallow angle would be a long country table covered with a large <br> 
    red blotter. Wooden boxes, flat pen-holders and pots of all kinds would hold <br> 
    pencils, paper-clips, staples large and small. A glass tile would serve as an ash- <br> 
    tray. A circular black leather box decorated with gold-leaf arabesques would <br> 
    be filled with cigarettes. Light would come from an old desk-lamp, adjustable <br>
    only with difficulty, fitted with a green opaline lampshade shaped like a visor. <br> 
    On each side of the table, virtually facing each other, would be two high-<br> 
    backed wood and leather armchairs. Still further to the left, along the wall, <br> 
    would be a narrow table overflowing with books. A wing-chair in bottle-green <br> 
    leather would lead to grey metal filing cabinets and light wooden card-index <br> 
    boxes. On a third, even smaller table would be a Swedish lamp and a type-<br> 
    writer under its canvas dust-cover. Right at the back would be a narrow bed <br> 
    covered in ultramarine velvet and stacked with cushions of all colours. On a <br> 
    painted wooden stand, almost in the middle of the room, there would be a <br> 
    globe made of papier-mâché and nickel silver, illustrated in naïf style, a fake <Br> 
    antique. Behind the desk, half-hidden by the red curtain at the window, would <br> 
    be an oiled-wood ladder which could slide on a brass rail all the way round <br> 
    the room.

  There, life would be easy, simple. All the servitudes, all the problems <br> 
    brought by material existence would find a natural solution. A cleaning lady <br> 
    would come every morning. Every fortnight, wine, oil and sugar would be <br>
    delivered. There would be a huge, bright kitchen with blue tiles decorated <br> 
    with heraldic emblems, three china plates decorated with yellow arabesques <br> 
    in metallic paint, cupboards everywhere, a handsome whitewood table in the <br> 
    middle with stools and bench-seats. It would be pleasant to come and sit there,<br> 
    every morning, after a shower, scarcely dressed. On the table there would be a <br> 
    sizeable stoneware butter dish, jars of marmalade, honey, toast, grapefruit cut <br>
    in two. It would be early. It would be May, the start of a long summer's day.<br>

They would open the mail, they would open the newspapers. They would light <br> 
    their first cigarette. They would go out. Their work would keep them busy for<br> 
    a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet for lunch, a sandwich or a<br> 
    steak, according to their mood; they would have coffee at a street café and then<br>
    go home, on foot, slowly.

  Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness <br> 
    would be its greatest charm. They would hardly bother themselves with it: they <br> 
    would live in it. The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be<br> 
    an established fact, a datum, a state of their nature. Their attention would be <br> 
    elsewhere: on the book they would open, on the text they would draft, on the<br> 
    record they would listen to, on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. They <br> 
    would work for a long while. Then they would dine, or go out for dinner; <br> 
    they would see old friends; they would walk together.

  Sometimes it would <br> 
    seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these <br> 
    book-lined walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that <br> 
    they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beau-<br> 
    tiful things had only ever been made for their sole use. But they wouldn't <br> 
    feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adven-<br> 
    ture. No plan seemed impossible to them. They would not know rancour, or <br> 
    bitterness, or envy. For their means and their desires would always match in <br> 
    all ways. They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with <br> 
    their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and to reveal it in <br> 
    every moment of their living, together.
