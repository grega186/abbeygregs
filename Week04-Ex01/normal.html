        Your eye, first <strong>of all,</strong> would glide over the <strong>grey</strong> fitted carpet in the
        <strong>narrow,</strong><br />
        long and high-<strong>ceilinged</strong> corridor. Its walls <strong>would</strong> be cupboards, in
        <strong>light-</strong><br />
        coloured wood, <strong>with</strong> fittings of gleaming <strong>brass.</strong> Three prints,<strong>
          depicting,</strong
        >
        <br />
        respectively, the <strong>Derby</strong> winner Thunderbird, <strong>a </strong>paddle-steamer
        <strong>named</strong>
        <br />
        Ville-de-Motitereau, <strong>and</strong> a Stephenson <strong>locomotive,</strong> would lead
        <strong>to a </strong><br />
        leather curtain <strong>hanging</strong> on thick, black, <strong>grainy</strong> wooden rings
        <strong>which</strong>
        <br />
        would slide back <strong>at the</strong> merest touch. <strong>There,</strong> the carpet would<strong>
          give</strong
        >
        <br />
        way to an almost <strong>yellow</strong> woodblock floor, <strong>partly</strong> covered by
        <strong>three </strong><br />
        faded rugs. It <strong>would be</strong> a living room <strong>about</strong> twenty-three feet
        <strong>long</strong>
        <br />
        by ten feet <strong>wide. On</strong> the left, in a <strong>kind of</strong> recess, there would<strong>
          be a</strong
        >
        <br />
        large sofa <strong>upholstered</strong> in worn black <strong>leather,</strong> with pale
        <strong>cherrywood</strong>
        <br />
        bookcases on <Strong>either</strong> side, heaped with <strong>books</strong> in untidy piles.
        <strong>Above</strong>
        <br />
        the sofa, a <strong>mariner's</strong> chart would <strong>fill the</strong> whole length of that
        <strong>sec-</strong>
        <br />
        tion of the <strong>wall.</strong> On the other <strong>side of</strong> a small low table,
        <strong>and be-</strong><br />
        neath a <strong>silk</strong> prayer-mat <strong>nailed to</strong> the wall with three
        <strong>large-</strong><br />
        headed <strong>brass</strong> studs, <strong>matching</strong> the leather curtain, <strong>there </strong
        ><br />
        would <strong>be</strong> another <strong>sofa, at</strong> right angles to the <strong>first, </strong
        ><br />
        with <strong>a</strong> light-brown <strong>velvet</strong> covering; it<strong> would </strong> <br />
        lead <strong>on</strong> to a small <strong>and</strong> spindly <strong>piece of </strong><br />
        <Strong>furniture,</strong> lacquered <strong>in</strong> dark <strong>red and </strong><br />
        <strong>providing three display helves </strong><br />
        <strong>for knick-knacks: agates and </strong><br />
        <strong>stone eggs, snuffboxes, candy-</strong><candy-><br /><strong>boxes, jade ashtrays, amother-</strong><br />
        <strong>of-pearl oystershell, a silver </strong><br />
        <strong>fob</strong> watch, a <strong>cut-glass glass, a </strong><br />
        <strong>crystal </strong>pyramid, <strong>a</strong> miniature<strong> in </strong><br />
        an <strong>oval</strong> frame. <strong>Further</strong> on,<strong> beyond </strong><br />
        a <strong>padded</strong> door, <strong>there</strong> would be <strong>shelving</strong> <br />
        on <strong>both</strong> sides of <strong>the</strong> corner, for caskets <strong>and </strong><br />
        for <strong>records,</strong> beside <strong>a</strong> closed gramophone <strong>of </strong><br />
        which <strong>only</strong> four <strong>machined</strong>-steel knobs <strong>would</strong> <br />
        be <strong>visible,</strong> and above <strong>it, a </strong>print depicting <strong>The Great</strong> <br />
        Parade <strong>of</strong> the Military <strong>Tattoo.</strong> Through the window,<strong>dra-</strong>  <br />
        ped with <strong>white</strong> and brown <strong>curtains</strong> in cloth imitating <strong>Jouy </strong><br />
        wallpaper, <strong>you </strong>would glimpse<strong> a few</strong> trees, a tiny park, <strong>a bit </strong></strong><br />
        of street. <strong>A roll</strong>-top desk littered <strong>with</strong> papers and pen-<strong>holders </strong><br />
        would go <strong>with</strong> a small cane-seated <strong>chair.</strong> On a console <strong>table </strong><br />
        would be <strong>a </strong>telephone, a leather <strong>diary, a</strong> writing pad. <strong>Then, on </strong><br />
        the other <strong>side</strong> of another door, <strong>beyond </strong>a low, square <strong>revolving </strong><br />
        bookcase <strong>supporting</strong> a large, <strong>cylindrical</strong> vase decorated in <strong>blue</strong><br />
        and filled <strong>with</strong> yellow roses, set <strong>beneath</strong> an oblong mirror <strong>in a </strong><br />
        mahogany <strong>frame,</strong> there would be <strong>a narrow</strong> table with its <strong>two ben-</strong> <br />
        ches <strong>upholstered</strong> in tartan, which <strong>would</strong> bring your eye back <strong>to the</strong>
        <br />
        leather <strong>curtain.</strong> It would be all in <strong>browns,</strong> ochres, duns and <strong>yellows:</strong><br />
        a world of <strong>slightly</strong> dull colours, in <strong>carefully</strong> graded shades, <strong>calcu-</strong><br />
        lated with <strong>almost</strong> too much artistry, <strong>in the</strong> midst of which <strong>would be</strong>
        <br />
        some striking, <strong>brighter</strong> splashes - a <strong>cushion</strong> in almost garish <strong>orange,</strong>
        <br />
        a few <strong>multicoloured</strong> book jackets <strong>amongst the</strong> leather-bound <strong>volumes.</strong>
        <br />
        During the <strong>day,</strong> the light flooding in <strong>would</strong> make this room seem a <strong>little</strong>
        <br />
        sad, despite <strong>the</strong> roses. It would be an <strong>evening</strong> room. But in the <strong>winter,</strong>
        <br />
        with the <strong>curtains</strong> drawn, some spots <strong>illuminated</strong> - the bookcase <strong>corner,</strong>
        <br />
        the record <strong>shelves,</strong> the desk, the low <strong>table</strong> between the two <strong>settees, and</strong> 
        <br />
        the vague <strong>reflections</strong> in the mirror — <strong>and large</strong> expanses in <strong>shadow,</strong><br />
        whence all the <strong>things</strong> would gleam - the <strong>polished </strong>wood, the rich, <strong>heavy</strong>
        <br />
        silks, the cut <strong>glass,</strong> the softened leather — <strong>it would</strong> be a haven of
        <strong>peace,</strong>
        <br />
        a land of <strong>happiness.</strong> The first door would open <strong>onto</strong> a bedroom, <strong>its floor</strong>
        <br />
        covered with <strong>a light</strong>-coloured fitted carpet. An <strong>English</strong> double <strong>bed would</strong>
        <br />
        fill the whole <strong>rear</strong> part of it. On the right, to <strong>both sides</strong> of the
        <strong>window, </strong> <br />
        there would be tall <strong>and </strong>narrow sets of shelves holding <strong>a</strong> few books, to <strong>be </strong>
        <br />
        read and read <strong>again,</strong> photograph albums, packs of  <strong>cards,</strong> pots, <strong>
        necklaces,</strong>
        <br />
        paste jewellery. <strong>To the</strong> left, an old oak wardrobe <strong>and two</strong> clothes <strong>horses of
        </strong>
        <br />
        wood and brass <strong>would</strong> stand opposite a small <strong>wing-chair</strong> upholstered in
        <strong>thin-</strong><br />
        striped grey <strong>silk</strong> and a dressing table. Through a <strong>half-open</strong> door <strong>giving
        on</strong><br />
        to a bathroom <strong>you</strong> would glimpse thick bathrobes, <strong>swan-neck </strong>taps in <strong>solid</strong>
        <br />
        brass, a large <strong>adjustable </strong>mirror, a pair of cut-<strong>throat</strong> razors and their<strong>
        green</strong> <br />
        leather sheaths, <strong>bottles,</strong> horn-handled brushes, <strong>sponges.</strong>

        <strong>On</strong> the wall, above the <strong>bed</strong> made up and turned <strong>down for</strong> the night,
        between <br />
        <strong>two </strong>small wall lamps, <strong>the</strong> astonishing, long, narrow <strong>black</strong>-and-white
        photo-<br />
        <strong>graph</strong> of a bird in the <strong>sky</strong> would surprise you by its <strong>slightly</strong> formal
        perfec- <br /><strong>tion.</strong> The second door <strong>would</strong> reveal a study. From <strong>top to</strong>
        bottom the walls <br /><strong>would</strong> be lined with <strong>books</strong> and periodicals with,
        here <strong>and</strong> there, so as to <br /><strong>break</strong> the continuity of <strong>bindings</strong> and
        jackets, a number <strong>of</strong> prints, drawings<br />
        <strong>and</strong> photographs - <strong>Antonello</strong> da Messina's Saint Jerome, <strong>a </strong>detail from The
        <br /><strong>Triumph</strong> of Saint George, <strong>one </strong>of Piranesi's dungeons, a <strong>portrait</strong> by
        Ingres,<br /><strong>a little</strong> pen- and-ink <strong>landscape</strong> by Klee, a sepia-tint
        <strong>photograph</strong> of Renan <br /><strong>in his room</strong> at the Collège <strong>de France,</strong> a
        Steinberg department <strong>store,</strong> Cranach's <br /><strong>Melanchthon</strong> - pinned to
        <strong>wooden</strong> panels set into the <strong>shelving.</strong> Slightly to <br /><strong>the left</strong> of the
        window and at a <strong>shallow</strong> angle would be a <strong>long</strong> country table
        <br /><strong>covered with</strong> a large red blotter. <strong>Wooden</strong> boxes, flat pen-<strong>holders</strong>
        and pots of <br /><strong>all</strong> kinds would hold pencils, <strong>paper-clips,</strong> staples
        <strong>large</strong> and small. A <br /><strong>glass</strong> tile would serve as an <strong>ashtray.</strong> A
        circular <strong>black</strong> leather box <br /><strong>decorated </strong>with gold-leaf <strong>arabesques</strong>
        would be <strong>filled</strong> with cig-<br /><strong>arettes.</strong> Light would <strong>come from</strong> an old
        <strong>desk-lamp,</strong> ad-<br /><strong>justable</strong> only with difficulty, <strong>fitted</strong> with a <strong>green</strong>
        opa-<br /><strong>line lampshade</strong> shaped <strong>like a</strong> visor. On <strong>each</strong> side<br />
        <strong>of the</strong> table, <strong>virtually</strong> facing each <strong>other,</strong> <br /><strong>would be two
        high-backed wood and </strong><br /><strong>leather armchairs. Still further to </strong><br /><strong>the
        left, along the wall, would be</strong><br />
        <strong>a narrow table overflowing with</strong> <br /><strong>books. A wing-chair in
        bottle-green</strong> <br />
        <strong>leather </strong> would <strong>lead</strong> to grey metal <strong>filing</strong> <br /><strong>cabinets</strong>  and <strong>light</strong> wooden
        <strong>card-index</strong>
        <br />
        <strong>boxes.</strong>  On a <strong>third,</strong> even <Strong>smaller</strong> table <br /><strong>would</strong>  be a Swedish <strong>lamp</strong> and
        a <strong>type</strong>-writer<br />
        <strong>under</strong>  its canvas <strong>dust-cover.</strong> Right <strong>at</strong> the back<br />
        <strong>would</strong>  be a narrow bed <strong>covered</strong> in <strong>ultramarine</strong> velvet <br /><strong>and stacked</strong> 
        with cushions of all <strong>colours.</strong> On a <strong>painted</strong> wooden <br />
        <strong>stand,</strong>  almost in the middle of the <strong>room,</strong> there <strong>would be</strong> a globe
        <br /><strong>made</strong> of papier-mâché and nickel <strong>silver,</strong> illustrated <strong>in naïf</strong> style,
        a <br /><strong>fake</strong> antique. Behind the desk, <strong>half-hidden</strong> by the red <strong>curtain</strong> at
        the <br /><strong>window,</strong> would be an oiled-<strong>wood</strong> ladder which could <strong>slide</strong> on a
        brass <br /><strong>rail all</strong> the way round the <strong>room.</strong> There, life would be <strong>easy,</strong>
        simple. All <br /><strong>the </strong>servitudes, all the <strong>problems</strong> brought by material
        <strong>existence</strong> would <br /><strong>find a</strong> natural solution. A <strong>cleaning</strong> lady would
        come <strong>every morning.</strong> Ev-<br /><strong>ery</strong> fortnight, wine, oil and <strong>sugar</strong> would be
        delivered. <strong>There</strong> would be a <br /><strong>huge,</strong> bright kitchen with blue <strong>tiles</strong>
        decorated with heraldic <strong>emblems,</strong> three <br /><strong>china</strong> plates decorated with
        <strong>yellow</strong> arabesques in metallic <strong>paint,</strong> cupboards <br /><strong>everywhere,</strong> a
        handsome <strong>whitewood</strong> table in the <strong>middle with</strong> stools and
        <br /><strong>bench-seats.</strong> It would be pleasant <strong>to</strong> come and sit there, <strong>every</strong>
        morning, after <br /><strong>a shower,</strong> scarcely dressed. On <strong>the</strong> table there
        would be <strong>a sizeable</strong> stoneware <br /><strong>butter</strong> dish, jars of marmalade,
        <strong>honey,</strong> toast, grapefruit <strong>cut in</strong> two. They would <br /><strong>open</strong> the mail,
        they would <strong>open</strong> the newspapers. They <strong>would</strong> light their first<br />
        <strong>cigarette.</strong> They would go out. <strong>Their</strong> work would keep them <strong>busy</strong> for a few
        hours <br /><strong>only, in</strong> the morning. They <strong>would meet</strong> for lunch, a sandwich
        <Strong>or</strong> a steak, accord-<br /><strong>ing to</strong> their mood; they would <strong>have</strong> coffee at a
        street café <strong>and</strong> then go home, on <br /><strong>foot, slowly.</strong> Their flat would
        <strong>rarely</strong> be tidy, but its very <strong>untidiness</strong> would be its <br /><strong>greatest</strong>
        charm. They would <strong>hardly</strong> bother themselves <strong>with it:</strong> they would live<br />
        <strong>in it. The </strong>comfort of their <strong>surroundings</strong> would seem to <strong>them to</strong> be an
        established <br /><strong>fact, a </strong>datum, a state of their <strong>nature.</strong> Their
        attention <strong>would be</strong> elsewhere: on the<br />
        <strong>book</strong> they would open, on <strong>the text</strong> they would draft, <strong>on the</strong> record they
        would <br /><strong>listen to,</strong>
        on their dialogue <strong>engaged</strong> afresh each day. <strong>They
        would</strong> work for a long <br /><strong>while.</strong> Then they would <strong>dine, or</strong> go out for
        dinner; <strong>they would</strong> see old friends; <br /><strong>they would</strong> walk together.
        <strong>Sometimes</strong> it would seem to <strong>them that</strong> a whole life could <br /><strong>be led</strong>
        harmoniously <strong>between these</strong> book-lined walls, <strong>amongst</strong> these objects so
        <br /><strong>perfectly</strong> domesticated that <strong>they would</strong> have ended up <Strong>believing</strong>
        these bright, soft, <br /><strong>simple</strong> and beautiful things <strong>had only</strong> ever been
        made <strong>for their</strong> sole use. But they <br /><strong>wouldn't</strong> feel enslaved by <strong>them:</strong>
        on some days, <strong>they would</strong> go off on a chance <br /><strong>adventure.</strong> No plan
        seemed <strong>impossible</strong> to them. They <strong>would not</strong> know rancour, or
        <br />
        <strong>bitterness,</strong> or envy. For their <strong>means</strong> and their desires <strong>would</strong> always
        match in
        <br />
        <strong>all ways.</strong> They would call this <strong>balance</strong> happiness and, with <strong>their</strong>
        freedom, with <br />
        <strong>their wisdom</strong> and their culture, they <strong>would know</strong> how to retain <strong>and to</strong>
        reveal it in <br />
        <Strong>every</strong> moment of their <strong>living,</strong> together.
